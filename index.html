                        <h4>SQA INTERN, CONTOUR SOFTWARE</h4>
                        <p>
                            As a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) intern, I am responsible for performing manual
                            testing,
                            developing test cases, and tracking software defects to ensure quality and functionality. My
                            role also
                            involves documenting test results and reporting issues to support quality standards in the
                            software
                            development process. Additionally, I have gained foundational knowledge of automation tools
                            like
                            Cypress, Postman, and Playwright, which enhances my understanding of testing frameworks and
                            automation basics. This experience has strengthened my skills in quality assurance and
                            familiarized me
                            with essential testing tools.

                            As a proficient Angular developer, I spearhead the creation and maintenance of feature-rich,

                            knowledge of
                            Angular's functionalities to design and implement robust UIs. To guarantee a cohesive and

                            Material

                            collaborating closely with the team to translate UI/UX mockups from Figma into functional
                            interfaces. I
                            actively participate in sprint planning meetings and utilize Toggle Track to meticulously
                            manage my
